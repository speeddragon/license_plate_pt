# License Plate 

Portuguese license plate evolved along the years. Visually they were represented
initially by two letters and four numbers splitted in two groups of two digits 
each with a dash separating letters and the numbers group.

Example: `AA-00-01`, `RS-98-78`

## Type 1 

Since January 1937 a new format was created. A valid license plate has the
following format: 2 letters and 4 numbers, separated by a dash in each group of
two.

Example: `AA-00-01`, `ZZ-98-76`

This is the only format were a sequential license plate doesn't necessarily mean
is older or newer then the other, except in some special cases for type 2, 3 and
4.

## Type 2

right side of the license plate, keeping the 4 numbers in the left side.

numbers, in which the 4 letters are divided in two groups of two letters each.

Because some combination might produce bad words, there are some rules on which
a license plate could be invalid.

* 1st 2nd 3rd position of the letters can't be vowels. 
* 2nd, 3rd and 4th position of the letters can't be vowels. 
* 2nd and 4th position of the letters can't be vowels.
* `AA-00-AA` isn't a valid license plate, but every other starting in 00 is valid.
